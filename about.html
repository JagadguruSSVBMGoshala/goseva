    <p class="english">
      <strong>Jagadguru Sri Sri Vidhushekhara Bharati Mahaswamy Goshala</strong>
      is envisioned as a dharmic institution dedicated to the protection,
      care, and reverential service of cows. It is not conceived as a temporary
      refuge, but as a sustained space of responsibility, discipline, and compassion.

  <!-- PURPOSE -->
  <section class="content-block">
    <h2>Purpose & Vision</h2>

    <p class="english">
      The purpose of this Goshala extends beyond sheltering cattle.
      It aims to create an environment where cows are cared for with dignity,
      free from commercial pressure, neglect, or exploitation.
    </p>

    <p class="english">
      Every aspect of the Goshala — from feeding practices to medical care —
      is guided by the understanding that the cow is not a commodity,
      but a living presence deserving respect and protection.

    <h2>Daily Practices</h2>

    <p class="english">
      The Goshala follows structured daily routines that ensure

      Special attention is given to aged, injured, and abandoned cattle.
    </p>

    <p class="english">
      Seva is performed not as an obligation, but as a conscious offering,

  <!-- DIFFERENTIATION -->
  <section class="content-block">
    <h2>What Makes This Goshala Distinct</h2>

    <p class="english">
      Unlike commercial or utility-driven cattle shelters, this Goshala is guided
      by spiritual accountability. Decisions are taken with long-term welfare in mind,
      rather than short-term convenience.
    </p>

    <p class="english">
      The institution aspires to remain transparent, community-oriented,
      and aligned with dharmic values — ensuring that Go-seva here is both
      meaningful and sustainable.
